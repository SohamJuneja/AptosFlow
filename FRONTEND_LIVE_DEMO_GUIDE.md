## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Make sure backend is running!**
   ```bash
   node real-execution-engine.js
   ```
   If it's not running, the autonomous response won't happen

2. **Wait patiently**
   - Backend polls every 10 seconds
   - Frontend polls every 5 seconds
   - Total time: 10-30 seconds usually

3. **Check your balance**
   - You need at least 0.015 APT
   - Executor needs at least 0.002 APT

4. **Network must be Testnet**
   - Make sure wallet is on Aptos Testnet
   - Make sure backend is on Testnet
